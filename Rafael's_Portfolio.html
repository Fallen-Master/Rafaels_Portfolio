                                <p>This was the first website that I made, and it was supposed to be simple. I became so fixated on ensuring that the website looked like the example that I overlooked the presence of an available image. The centerpiece, where it says "COMING SOON," was intended to be an image.
                                </p>

                                <p>I learned this lesson the hard way, but now I make sure to understand the components and utilize the available resources effectively. Please feel free to visit the website and check out my CSS and HTML.
